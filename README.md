# Formula 1 Data

This Python script is designed to scrape data from a Formula 1 website, perform data corrections for specific Grand Prix events (Sao Paulo, Miami, and Monaco), and save the cleaned data to a CSV file. The script uses the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and pandas for data manipulation.

The script includes a section for data correction for specific Grand Prix events. It corrects race positions and constructor's championship points for drivers who have been assigned incorrect positions or points. The events currently supported are:

-Sao Paulo GP
-Miami GP
-Monaco GP

Contributions to this script are welcome. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
